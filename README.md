# API201Z---PSET1
This repo is for my April, 2020 reproduction of Problem Set #1 from my 2014 statistics course at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government (API-201z). 

The only files that are original from that course are the Answer Key PDF and the Pine Street Inn Length of Stay excel spreadsheet. 

To complete this excercise I manually created the "statenames.csv" file used in the second half of the exercise by using a short R script file. My answers to the questions dependent on the state population values are slightly different from the answers in the problem set answer key. I believe this is due to slightly different population estimates used for the 50 states and the District of Colombia. 

All work is my own and I do not make any guarantee that the code or the solutions provided are correct. I used this problem set recreation as a way to gain experience using RMarkdown and RStudio's git and GitHub interfaces.
